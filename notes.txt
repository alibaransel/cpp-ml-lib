--- Service Structure ---

File Service -> Reading and Writing data to files
Data Service -> Preparing data to use
Machine Learning Service -> Create, Train and Make Prediction with Model
Interface Service -> Use Terminal to all operations (Selections, writing and reading data)
Device Service -> Determine the availability of operations for device
Computation Service -> Parallel Computation on both CPU and GPU
